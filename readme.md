# MIND Intern Data Project

A dataset is located in the `data` folder. That dataset contains a districts' 1st and 2nd grade students' end-of-year ST Math syllabus progress (% of curriculum completed) and their total amount of minutes logged into the ST Math program. `iid` refers to the id of the student's school while the `gcd` column refers to the student's grade within ST Math.

We would think that (on average) more minutes (variable: `total_minutes` spent playing ST Math would mean more overall content (variable: `content_progress`) completed. Does the data appear to confirm or deny this? If there is a relationship, what kind of relationship? Is there a difference across grades?

Use whatever methods you think are relevant. Compiling your findings in some kind of report would be ideal. Please don't spend more than a few hours on this (for your own sake). I am mostly interested in seeing how you approach an open-ended problem like this and how you justify your conclusions.
